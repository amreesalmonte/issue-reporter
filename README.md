# issue-reporter
Uses the github API to watch for new issues. This project was done as part of an interview process.

Specifications:
- watches for new issues and reports them (with title, id, other info if you like, but fairly compact)
- reports issues being closed (with same info as above)
- whenever an issue is added/closed, reports the number of total existing/closed issues, but does not show details of the other issues
